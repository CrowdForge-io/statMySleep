# statMySleep
(enter hours of your sleep and see stats of it)

Welcome here,
I'm pretty new to Python so I wanna exercise,
maybe finding nice projects with others.

I'm still working on this, just the first try from today,
will be updated the following days :)

Upload changes or write me for anything!


Version 1 :

Optimized to an optional name (through this different ID's can be better organised within the file):
You can enter hours of slept for every day, from Monday to Sunday.
After this a plot will be created which you can optionally see or save (all files go to same path like your program).
Your data will be put into a DataFrame which you can write to your file, remember to choose 'create'
when you use it the first time, so the program can really create it. After just choose 'write' the file will automatically 
update it and add a new entry.
The entries are made together with your current date+time and your week number, also your name and the other stats 
(like average sleep and hours of sleep of every day)
If you use this program together with others, take the same names so you can keep an overview.
For feedback and critics, leave me a message here.
